# IMPORTANT: BRISQUE Model Files Required

This directory should contain the BRISQUE model files:
- brisque_model_live.yml
- brisque_range_live.yml

## Where to Get These Files

These files are required for the BRISQUE algorithm to work. You can obtain them from:

1. **OpenCV Contributions Repository**: 
   https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib/tree/master/modules/quality/samples

2. **Download directly**:
   - Model file: https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib/raw/master/modules/quality/samples/brisque_model_live.yml
   - Range file: https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib/raw/master/modules/quality/samples/brisque_range_live.yml

## Instructions

1. Download both files from the links above
2. Place them in this `Models` directory
3. Ensure the file names match exactly:
   - `brisque_model_live.yml`
   - `brisque_range_live.yml`

The application will not work without these files.
